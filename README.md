# Neural-Network_Image-Classification

## Overview
This GitHub project revisits the classic Dogs vs. Cats image classification problem hosted by Kaggle in 2013. The machine learning landscape has evolved significantly since then, particularly in deep learning and image analysis. The competition, once a for-fun challenge, is now reintroduced as a playground competition with kernels enabled.

## Project Structure
### Dataset Description: Provide details about the dataset. The "train" folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, each labeled in the filename. The "test" folder has 12,500 images for prediction.

1. Download Dataset: Provide instructions on how to download the dataset from the Kaggle competition page.
2. Project Goals: The goal of this project is to explore modern techniques in image classification and practice new methods on a familiar dataset. While Dogs vs. Cats may seem like a solved problem, the intention is to encourage the application of cutting-edge techniques to pave the way for addressing future challenges in machine learning.
3. Contribution Guidelines
- Pull Requests Welcome: Encourage contributions from the data science and machine learning community. Invite users to submit pull requests with their improvements, updates, or innovative approaches.
4. Acknowledgments
- Kaggle: Express gratitude to Kaggle for providing the platform and hosting the original competition.

Community: Acknowledge the contributions and engagement of the data science community.
